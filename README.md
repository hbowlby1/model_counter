## Excel totals reader
## Owner Harrison Bowlby

This is a tool I created for the company Sollid Cabinetry that helps in determining the total counts of certain inventory stock.

## Installation
If you do not have it installed already or are not using Anaconda you will need to install pandas. "pip install pandas" And you'll need python installed if you already do not have it.

## Usage
At the moment the code only runs when you replace the sheet location for the excelReader function on line 38. In the future I plan to add a GUI that allows you to input the location from anywhere.

Feel free to grab this code and use it for your own
